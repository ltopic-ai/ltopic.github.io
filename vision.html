  <h1>Vision and Research Directions</h1>

  <h2>Observation</h2>
  <p>
    A large portion of current artificial intelligence systems relies on
    short-term, stateless interactions. Despite impressive capabilities,
    these systems struggle to maintain a coherent internal state, accumulate
    durable experience, and reason over extended time horizons.
  </p>

  <p>
    This limitation restricts the emergence of long-term goal-oriented
    behavior and the ability to build a progressively structured
    understanding of the world.
  </p>

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    L-TOPIC explores an alternative path: cognitive architectures capable of
    maintaining a persistent internal state, integrating experience over
    time, and reasoning about evolving, multi-level objectives.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project follows a progressive and experimental research approach,
    aiming to understand how AGI-like functional properties may emerge from
    clearly identified conceptual building blocks, without premature claims.
  </p>

  <h2>Research Axes</h2>

  <h3>1. Persistent Memory</h3>
  <p>
    Investigation of memory mechanisms that extend beyond single interactions,
    enabling the system to retain knowledge, states, and experiences usable
    over long periods.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Internal World Models</h3>
  <p>
    Exploration of internal representations that allow the system to build a
    structured model of its environment, past actions, and their consequences.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Long-Horizon Reasoning</h3>
  <p>
    Study of planning and reasoning mechanisms capable of integrating
    multiple, sometimes competing objectives across extended time horizons.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Cognitive Continuity and Coherence</h3>
  <p>
    Research into the stability of the system’s cognitive identity and its
    ability to maintain internal coherence as context, objectives, and
    knowledge evolve.
  </p>

  <h2>Positioning</h2>
  <p>
    L-TOPIC does not position itself as a completed Artificial General
    Intelligence. The project adopts a cautious, functional approach focused
    on exploring, measuring, and understanding properties associated with AGI,
    without excessive claims or marketing narratives.
  </p>

  <p>
    The emphasis is placed on conceptual clarity, reproducibility, and
    incremental evaluation of hypotheses.
